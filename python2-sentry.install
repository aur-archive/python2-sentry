No configuration for Sentry was detected. This will create one for you
located at:

    /etc/sentry/sentry.conf.py
    
You will most likely want to modify this file if you're planning on
using something other than SQLite as the backend database.

You can run the Sentry server with:

    /usr/bin/sentry --config=/etc/sentry/sentry.conf.py start

But be sure to edit the configuration file first!

If you're using systemd, this package will install a service file for
Sentry as "/usr/lib/systemd/system/sentry.service". Occasionally,
particularly if you're upgrading and the service file has changed,
you may need to run:

    systemctl --system daemon-reload
    
To reload the changed service file or in circumstances where systemd
complains upon restarting the service to launch the new version.

!!! NOTICE !!!

python2-sentry will be merged into sentry after December 1st, 2012.
Please install that package instead. This package will continue to
be maintained until that time.
